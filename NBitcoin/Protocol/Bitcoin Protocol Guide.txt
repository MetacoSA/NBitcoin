Hello!

Protocol is simple:

Connect to some nodes and make the Versionhandshake
If they send you a PingPayload, send back a PongPayload

How to get a Block:
send to a Node a GetHeadersPayload
Now the Node sends you a List of his Blockheaders
You get the Blockheader of the Block you want and save the Hash of that Block.
Now you send to the Node a GetDataPayload with that Hash and the Wish for a Block with that Hash.
The Node now will send you a BlockPayload with that hole Block in it.
